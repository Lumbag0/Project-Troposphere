# Project-Troposphere
Weather map application written in Python for CS-3300 Intro to Software Engineering at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs.

**Project-Troposphere is a interactive map of the world's current temperature**
  - Easy at-a-glance view
  - Zoom-based map changes
  - Color coded temperatures
  - Key location temperatures shown

**How does it work? What are some benefits?**
  - Uses free to use API Weatherbit to bulk grab weather information with accuraccy.
  - Weatherbit provides us with plenty of information you can add onto this project with.
  - We use high performance interactive map; folium, to plot the temperature on.
  - Systems to integrate the web based folium system to in-app usable.
  - We use a modular tiling system for countries and territories, which can be used else where.
  - Gradient calculation system for color coded tiles.
  - Can click on the tiles to get corresponding temperature information.
  - A simplistic design for features to be added onto it.
